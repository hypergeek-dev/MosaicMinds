## Validation of JavaScript Code

To ensure the quality and reliability of the JavaScript code in my project, I have used appropriate validation tools, such as linting tools. Here's an overview of the validation process:

1. **Linting**:
   - I utilized a linting tool to analyze my JavaScript code for potential errors, code style violations, and best practice adherence.
   - Final result: No errors. 


Overall, by conducting thorough manual testing of user stories and validating my JavaScript code, I aimed to ensure that the project meets the desired standards and functions correctly.
